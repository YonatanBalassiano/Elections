Elections - Object-oriented programming in C++

My very first C++ assignment in Object-oriented programming. Part of the SPL course in my degree.
Build a "Coalition run" program in which we were given a JSON file that holds the state after the election as a graph and more data on every coalition.
According to a set of rules, we perform a coalition run till we combine a valid government.

Implement some basic c++ principles
-	Use of pointers and references
-	Memory management and memory leak
-	Role of 5 for every class
-	Abstract classes and Polymorphism
